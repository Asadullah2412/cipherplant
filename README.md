# ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cipherplant.git
cd cipherplant
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```
flutter pub get
```

---

### 3️⃣ Run the app

```
flutter run
```

Make sure a **physical Android device** or emulator is connected.

# 📷 How It Works

1. User captures a leaf image.
2. The image is preprocessed (resize + normalization).
3. The TensorFlow Lite model performs inference on-device.
4. The model predicts the **plant and disease class**.
5. An LLM generates a **human-readable explanation and treatment advice**.
6. Results are displayed in the app.

# 📊 Example Output

```
Plant: Tomato
Disease: Early Blight
Confidence: 91%

Treatment:
Remove infected leaves and apply copper-based fungicide.
Avoid overhead watering to reduce fungal spread.
